# Data-Storage-and-Management-Project Summary 
  
  ## *MongoDB vs HBase comparison*
  
  1. The main aim of the project is to understand the characteristics, architecture and selection of the of the NoSQL databases 
      HBase and MongoDB.
  2. Installed data storage and management system HBase and MongoDB on the ubuntu. Devise and implemented a test strategy to perform a comparative analysis of the capabilities of each system in terms of the performance.
     For comparison purposes, researched on the capabilities of systems in following areas:
     
     • Storage and retrieval of Structured, Semi-Structured and Unstructured Data.
     • Scalability, Availability and Reliability.

   ## *An investigation into the utilisation of solid state Flash storage in Big-Data*
   
   1. Investigated into the utilisation of solid-state Flash storage in modern Big Data and predictive analytics processing environments. 
   2. Presented and provided a report on the utilisation Flash storage and protocols such as NVMe for analytics processing in terms of 
   latency,cost, reliability etc. 
   3. Comparative study between utilising Flash and alternative storage infrastructure has been made. 
   
   ## *compare performance of mongodb with the MYsql for differnent workload*
   
   Comparative study of NoSQL Database MongoDB AND sQL Database has been studied for the differnent workload* 
   
   Parameter of the Workload : 
   Workload 1 -- readcount = 12500, operationcount =12500
   Workload 2 -- readcount = 25000, operationcount =25000
   Workload 3 -- readcount = 50000, operationcount =50000
   Workload 4 -- readcount = 100000,operationcount =100000
